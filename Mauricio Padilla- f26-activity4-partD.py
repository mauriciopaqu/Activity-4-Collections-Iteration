# SCENARIO
# A restauraunt wants a simple ordering system that allows customers to browse a menu, select items, and calculate their total bill.

menu  = {
    "Burger" : 12.00,
    "Pizza" : 15.00,
    "Salad" : 9.00,
    "Fries" : 5.00,
    "Drink" : 3.00
}

order = []

# TODO 1: Print out the entire menu and the price of each item

# TODO 2: Start a loop, asking the customer which item they would like to order

    # TODO 3: If the customer types a word check whether the requested item exists

    # TODO 4: Add valid items to the customer's order and let the loop continue

    # TODO 5: if the customer types "Done", end the loop and move to end of order

# TODO 6: Print out an itemized receipt for the user showing item and cost

# TODO 7: Print out the subtotal of the entire order


# EXPECTED OUTPUT
# Order: Burger - 12.00
#        Fries  -  5.00
#        Drink  -  3.00
#         TOTAL: $20.00
